[Target]
update_target = 
##Allowed options are:
#XD670 - BMC, BMCImage2, BIOS, BIOS2, SCM_CPLD1_MB_CPLD1, BPB_CPLD, GPU_ALL
##BMC is equivalent to BMCImage1 here for Cray XD670 systems with Non-RoT motherboards (BMC remains same as there is only a single target which is equal to BMC for RoT motherboards)
##BPB_CPLD is the update of BPB_CPLD1 and BPB_CPLD2 firmwares back to back, it requires only one hpm file
##SCM_CPLD1_MB_CPLD1 is the update of SCM_CPLD1 and MB_CPLD1 firmwares back to back, update files for the same should be mentioned as 
#SCM_CPLD1_file.hpm MB_CPLD1_file.hpm ##first file to be of SCM_CPLD1 and space and followed by MB_CPLD1 hpm file
##GPU_ALL is to update all components in the GPU (Firmware type should be HMC)
##all targets are case-sensitive. Please follow the exact same cases.

##Allowed options(Default: HPM):
#Mention firmware type only for below components
#HPM : For BMC, BIOS and CPLD components(MB_CPLD, SCM_CPLD, BPB_CPLD)
#HMC : For complete GPU update
